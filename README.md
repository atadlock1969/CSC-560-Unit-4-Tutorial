I found learning Angular via StackBlitz was interesting. The difficulty for me is that tutorials or step by step activities makes it hard for me to really grasps the framework without preparation steps. It became confusing jumping from component to component and not always understanding how some of the untouched components work such as what was the shipping.component.spec.ts used for. Every time a new set of components were created the spec files were created. While it is my understanding from a quick search it is for unit testing, it would be great to see it in action. I am very contextual and need to relate. Without it, all the perfulous components causes confusion for me.

In general, I learn better with more context such as laying out the design and how to lay out the components before they are too be built. Since I am not a Javascript or Typescript technologist and do not develop beyond classes, understanding the constructs are harder without that understanding. From the tutorial I am not sure I will be able to add players for my next assignment, yet alone build out my last assignment. I won’t give up hope, just need a simpler understanding of Angular or more related to CRUD application at the least. I will try to do my due diligence and learn the linkages, functions, etc. to make the final application work. 

Lastly, I am not sure if the files you need should include all the npm packages. There are so many that it would take quite a bit of time to upload yet to ensure I upload the right ones. I am assuming, which I do not typically do is that I can export from Stackblitz to GitHub and that will suffice. I added a link that was from my own download if the direct update from Stackblitz is not sufficient.
 
Onward to keep on learning!
